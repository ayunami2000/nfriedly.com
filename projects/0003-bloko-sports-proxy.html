<p>The Bloko Sports Proxy allows you to browse the internet without fear of &quot;spoilers&quot; telling you the final score of a game you were looking forward to watching later.</p>
<p>I was brought into the Bloko project a little late into the game. Most of the functionality was built, but it was extremely disorganized, very slow, and full of bugs. The back-end was built around Sails.js + my node-unblocker project, and the front-end was a single gigantic &quot;spaghetti code&quot;  file of jQuery selectors, repeated AJAX calls, multi-purpose methods, and unmanaged global data structures.</p>
<p>I set to work fixing a large number of broken / unreliable features. In the process, I added some basic testing and code quality checks, organized the front-end into a Backbone.js app split into logical components, automated the deployment process, removed a ton of dead code and unused libraries, and made the entire project considerably more reliable and performant.</p>
