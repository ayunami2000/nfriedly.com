<p>Fun little browser-based game, sort of a cross between Doodle Jump and Moon Lander.
I put it together over my Christmas vacation with the primary goals of having some fun and getting more experience rendering 2d graphics.</p>
<p>While I&#39;m normally a big proponent of building on top of existing tools and frameworks, I decided to go &quot;bare metal&quot; with this one: the game itself is written in vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies whatsoever.</p>
<p>The background image is from NASA; all graphics are either hand drawn or prodecuraly generated. The levels themselves are procedurally generated.</p>
<p>On a desktop browser, the game uses arrow keys to navigate. However, on a mobile device, it use touch + tilt controls via the HTML5  <code>touchstart</code>/<code>touchend</code> and <code>deviceorientation</code> APIs.</p>
<p>Renders at a smooth 60 FPS on every device I&#39;ve tested on.</p>
