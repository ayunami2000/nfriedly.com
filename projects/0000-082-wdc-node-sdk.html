The <code>watson-developer-cloud</code> module on npm is currently the most popular way of accessing Watson APIs. 
It provides idiomatic Node.js access to every single public Watson API in a single consistent and easy-to-use package.</p>
<p>I took on responsibility for the overall library shortly after it&#39;s initial release, and have since authored a fair portion of it 
including several of the services, automated testing, documentation, and publishing.</p>
