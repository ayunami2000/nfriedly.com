<p>After more than a dozen years as nFriedly Web Development, I decided to rebrand my business as Incline. 
The new name better represent the growing size, scope, and goals of the business.</p>
<p>The design features a <a href="https://unsplash.com/@samferrara?photo=IEHPDNk2-8w">stunning mountain photo</a> 
captured by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@samferrara">Sam Ferrara</a>, and a color scheme chose to compliment it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s built with Jekyl and Bootstrap v4-alpha. 
At the time of writing, it&#39;s not fully complete, but it is live and functional.
It&#39;s currently using several emojii, 
although they will likely be replaced by Font Awesome once v5 ships.</p>
