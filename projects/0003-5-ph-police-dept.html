<p>The little town that I live in closed down their Police Department and started contracted the Sheriff a few years before I moved in.
I ended up with the old non-emergency phone number as my new home phone number :(</p>
<p>I set up a quick little site to help people searching for the number get the correct information (instead of calling me).</p>
