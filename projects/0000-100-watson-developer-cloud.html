<p>My first project at IBM was getting the WDC website ready for launch. This included some design changes and
a range of enhancements for performance, usability, accessibility, analytics, etc.</p>
<p>The site was a multi-page AngularJS with significant performance issues when I arrived. </p>
<p>My initial improvements to launch the site included script bundling and minification, a custom AngularJS directive for analytics, syntax highlighting, and automatic ToC generation.</p>
<p>Post-launch on I was able to use DocPad to statically generate the entire site, making it both more flexible, and significantly faster to load.</p>
