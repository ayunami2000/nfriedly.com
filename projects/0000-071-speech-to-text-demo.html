<p>The Speech to Text demo allows live transcription of microphone input, user-provided audio files,
and sample audio files via the Watson Text to Speech service.</p>
<p>I re-created the app, building on top of my <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-speech">Speech JavaScript SDK</a>
 and our <a href="https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/react-components/">React Components Library</a>.</p>
<p>The updated demo is cleaner, faster, mobile-friendly, better-tested, and easier to work on and extend than the earlier one.</p>
