<p>I used an Arduino and an IR Shield to fix a major annoyance with my TV:
it would turn the sound bar <em>off</em> but wouldn&#39;t turn it back <em>on.</em>
Now the Arduino is powered up whenever the TV comes on, and it in turn signals the sound bar to turn on.</p>
<p>I later rebuilt it with a Digispark to reduce free up my Arduino for other projects.</p>
