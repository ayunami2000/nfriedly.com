<p>I occasionally <a href="https://www.elance.com/s/nfriedly/">take on side projects via Elance</a>, and their payment system is really great at reliably getting funds into my Elance account.
And then they just sit there until I remember to withdrawal them to my bank. So, I built this bot.</p>
<p>The bot uses CasperJS to log into the site as me, check if I have any available funds, and immediately transfer them to my bank if I do.</p>
<p>It runs on Heroku once per day and gives me one less thing I have to remember to do.</p>
