<p>I gave an internal presentation at IBM on the Watson Developer Cloud Node.js <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr>
that goes through installation and setup and then builds a small app to analyze, translate, and speak text.</p>
<p>The presentation was done live, the video is from one of my practice runs with some slight editing.</p>
