<p>I built the previous version of my website with a PHP/CodeIgniter core and a custom theme designed by <a href="http://charleyskira.com/graphic-design/nfriedly-layout/">Charley Skira</a>.</p>
<p>The site served to introduce and support myself and my freelance business. Features included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts management system where clients could view past and current invoices and pay any balance due via a fully secured and PCI-compliant credit card processing system.</li>
<li>WordPress-based <a href="/techblog">technical blog</a> with a custom theme and a small plugin that I built  to seamlessly unite it with the rest of the site.</li>
<li>Portfolio and several SEO-optimized pages highlighting the various services I offered.</li>
<li>YUI-based &quot;Instant Estimate&quot; form that gave a hassle-free way of estimating a project&#39;s cost.</li>
<li><a href="/techblog/2009/06/how-to-build-a-spam-free-contact-forms-without-captchas/">Spam-proof contact form</a></li>
<li>Technical demos of working with various APIs from Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc.</li>
</ul>
