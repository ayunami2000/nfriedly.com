<p>I was invited to speak at the RoboUniverse 2015 conference; I hosted a workshop titled &quot;Knowledge Engines – Building Smart Applications that Learn&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The field of robotics is closely aligned with the work in Artificial Intelligence or AI. The brains of a robotic system can be cloud based and used in the operation of a robot, or could become an independent, stand alone system itself. The knowledge engines acquire information from natural language interfaces, perception, haptic interfaces, non-structured data and more. Knowledge Engines collect, organize, filter, and perform predictive analytics to provide guidance for future actions. In this workshop you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research work in building generic Knowledge Engines with broad applicability to a variety of robots and intelligence systems</li>
<li>How to get started with Knowledge Engine tools to build your own Intelligence Systems</li>
<li>How the digital brains are used to connect with the physical world of robotics</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My portion of the workshop covered a number of IBM Watson Services, and focused on showing demos and real-world use cases.
