<p>My second Watson/<abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> demo, this one uses an Arduino Yún to pull my recent tweets,
run them through the IBM Watson Personality Insights service, and display the &quot;Big 5&quot; personality traits on a LCD.</p>
<p>The Arduino calls a Python script on the Linux side of the Yún to connect to Watson and Twitter (mainly for https support), 
and then cycles through the results on the screen.</p>
<p>Can be powered from battery and tethered to a cellphone for complete portability.</p>
