<p>Facebook broke part of their website a while back such that app admins could no longer edit events that were created by their apps. We reported this to them and they <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/494984083903743">admitted it was a bug, but decided not to fix it</a>.</p>
<p>After going through several rounds of manually updating events via <code>curl</code>, I put together this little web app to make the job easier.</p>
<p>Built with jQuery, Bootstrap, Bootswatch and Font Awesome. Hosted on GitHub Pages, Bootstrap CDN, and CDNJS.</p>
