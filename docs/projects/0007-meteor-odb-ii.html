<p>I built this to look up ODB-II diagnostic codes from my phone. (And also because I wanted to learn <a href="http://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> a bit better.)</p>
<p>The tool searches through a database of codes as you type and also gives some general information about ODB-II and how to acquire the tools.</p>
<p>Continuously integrated with a suite of CasperJS (PhantomJS) tests and continuously deployed to Meteor&#39;s infrastructure after each GitHub push via Travis CI.</p>
