<p><a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> is a hosted <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> with a friendly-yet-powerful back-end UI, and an API-only front-end.
Their <a href="https://github.com/contentful/ui-extensions-sdk">UI Extension SDK</a> enables custom content fields to provide greater flexibility when needed.</p>
<p>Contentful Dictate was a quick 2-hour hack (+ some polish added later) to create a voice dictation text field with my Watson Speech SDK.</p>
<p>The extension automatically matches the content&#39;s locale to the closest Watson voice model, and also matches contentful&#39;s styles.</p>
<p>Given that microphone access is only available in fairly modern browsers, I was able to use quite a lot of ES6/ES2015 syntax without needing any ES5 transpilation.</p>
