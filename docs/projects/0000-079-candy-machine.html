We built a Watson-powered candy machine: it gives sweet or sour candy 
depending on the semtiment of one&#39;s statement. 
It was initially built for IBM&#39;s 2016 InterConnect event and then displayed at subsequent events including the Tribeca Film Festival.</p>
<p>I worked on both the hardware side, assembling an Arduino to control the machines, 
and the software side, developing the Watson Speech JS SDK that helps capture and transcribe the user&#39;s voice.
There was also a python script running in the background that orchestrated everything.</p>
