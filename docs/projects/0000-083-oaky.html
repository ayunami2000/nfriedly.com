<p>An IBM internal web app to assist with bringing new Watson APIs public. 
Connects to various services and servers including LDAP, DataPower, Eureka, Zuul, our Bluemix Service Broker, and others to ensure everything is aware of and correctly handling a given API.</p>
<p>My contributions included dockerizing the app and scaling it out to multiple processes/servers, 
adding support for moving an API through the Experimental/Beta/General availability stages, and numerous bug fixes and performance enhancements.</p>
<p>I also set up automated testing both with mocha-based unit tests and CasperJS-based UI and integration tests that run on each commit and report results to the team&#39;s Slack channel.</p>
