[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-358" title="Ring Ring!" alt="" src="http://nfriedly.com/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/1171473_phone_home-min.jpg" width="200" height="245" />][1]Even though I&#8217;ve been happily employed with [Sociable Labs][2] for a while now, I still get fairly frequent calls and emails from people who want to know if I&#8217;m available or I &#8220;know someone.&#8221; The list of people I know is starting to run short, so this post is intended to remedy that.

**If you are an individual Web Designer or Web Developer interested in work, please post a comment below.**

**<!--more-->**What to post:

*   Your name and website in the appropriate fields. I disabled WordPress&#8217;s `rel="nofollow"` just for you. 
    *   If you don&#8217;t have a website, get one! Sign up for a [Dreamhost account][3] and buy a template from [Theme Forest][4] and you&#8217;ll have a solid website in no time.
*   Your basic skillset. For me, it might be &#8220;Strong Javascript / Ajax, PHP, HTML, and CSS; basic Photoshop, ActionScript and Java&#8221;
*   A short bit about yourself and your experience.
*   Where you&#8217;re located, and if you would consider relocating for work.
*   What type of work you&#8217;re interested in: freelance / short-term contract (3-6 months or less), long-term contract, employment, startup, etc.

Tips:

*   This is your first impression to potential clients: Copy-paste it into Word and read it out loud once or twice. Get it right the first time because you can&#8217;t edit comments after you&#8217;ve posted them.
*   Contact information: any phone number or email address posted here will be picked up by spammers. 
    *   A basic solution is to just post a .jpg on your website with your phone number and email.
    *   A better solution could be a contact form like this one: [How to build a spam-free contact form without captchas][5]
*   One or two links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, or recent work is fine, but be warned that my WordPress marks** **anything with **more than 3 links as spam**, and it&#8217;s hidden until I get around to checking the spam filter.
*   Lastly, this is my website, and I may choose to edit or delete comments. For example, if you claim 10+ years experience with jQuery, your comment will be deleted. (JQuery was released in 2006)

Thanks and best wishes with your future work!
