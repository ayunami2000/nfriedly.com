Even worse, it charged the customers credit card each time, so a persistent customer could wind up with multiple charges which you would need to undo!

  The Fix
</h2>

<a href="http://nfriedly.com/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/cart32-fix.png" rel="lightbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-245 alignright" title="cart32-fix" src="http://nfriedly.com/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/cart32-fix-300x235.png" alt="cart32-fix" width="300" height="235" /></a>Cart32&#8242;s support was not particularly helpful (both the [Knowledge Base][1] and their phone support), but fortunately the fix was not very hard. The error basically means that it had trouble opening some file.

In our case the name of the file that orders were saved in (**Orders > Order Setting > Order Output File**) had gotten goofed and was set to the url of the website. The fix was to change it back to &#8220;**orders.txt**&#8220;.
