<img class="right" src="/img/portfolio/watson.svg" width="150" height="150" alt="" /> The Node.js npm library is currently the most popular way of accessing Watson services. 
It provides for idiomatic Node.js access to every single public Watson API in a single consistent and easy-to-use package.

My contributions include the Document Conversion API, the WebSocket portion of the Speech to Text API, process and automated testing improvements, several examples, and numerous other enhancements.
