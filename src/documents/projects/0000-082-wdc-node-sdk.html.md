<img class="right" src="/img/portfolio/watson.svg" width="150" height="150" alt="" /> The `watson-developer-cloud` module on npm is currently the most popular way of accessing Watson APIs. 
It provides idiomatic Node.js access to every single public Watson API in a single consistent and easy-to-use package.

My contributions include the Document Conversion API, the WebSocket portion of the Speech to Text API, process and automated testing improvements, several examples, automatic JSDoc generation and publishing, and numerous other enhancements.
I also wrote up a small announcement on the Watson Blog for the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/watson/blog/2015/12/15/ibm-watson-node-js-sdk-reaches-version-1-0/">1.0 release</a>.
