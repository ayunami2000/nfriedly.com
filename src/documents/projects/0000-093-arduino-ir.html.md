I used an Arduino and an IR Shield to fix a major annoyance with my TV:
it would turn the sound bar off but wouldn't turn it back on.
The Arduino is powered by the TV whenever the TV comes on, and it in turn powers on the sound bar.

I later rebuilt it with a Digispark to reduce free up my Arduino for other projects.
