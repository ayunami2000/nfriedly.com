<img class="right" src="/img/portfolio/ddg.png" alt="" />An OpenSearch plutin that allows visitors to add option to their browser's built-in search bar that uses Google Suggestions but preforms the searches on <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">Duck Duck Go</a>.

It also supports encrypted searches, and has a proxy built with node.js that corrects !bang's that Google removes from it's suggestions. 

The proxy originally sat behind a high-performance Nginx server, but has since been moved to heroku.
