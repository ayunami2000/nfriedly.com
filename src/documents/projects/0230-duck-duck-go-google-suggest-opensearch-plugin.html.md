<img class="left" src="/img/portfolio/ddg.png" alt="" />Allows visitors to add a search plugin to their browser's built-in search bar that uses Google Suggestions but preforms the searches on <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">Duck Duck Go</a>.
It also supports encrypted searches, and has a proxy built with node.js that corrects !bang's that Google removes from it's suggestions. The proxy sits behind a high-performance Nginx server.
