I oversaw a five-man team that rebuilt the shopping cart and database of a major clay products website.
The cart was designed from the ground up to handle their catalogue of over 10,000 products. It included a powerful meta-data based search engine, automatically generated navigation, and a full-featured administration area.
Technologies: e-Commerce, PHP, Javascript, jQuery, MySQL, Cart32, IIS 6.0, IIS 7.0, Microsoft URL Rewrite module 2.0, CodeIgniter
