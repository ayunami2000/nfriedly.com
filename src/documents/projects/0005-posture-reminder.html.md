A little web app that I put together one morning to annoy myself into having better posture. It asks how your posture is every so often. If it's good, then it waits a little longer before asking you again. But if your posture isn't so great, then it asks you much sooner the next time.

Built with jQuery, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome. Hosted on GitHub Pages, Bootstrap CDN, and CDNJS.
