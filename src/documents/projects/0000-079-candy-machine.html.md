We built a Watson-powered candy machine for IBM's 2016 InterConnect event: it gives either sweet or sour candy 
depending on if one said nice things or mean things.

I worked on both the hardware side, programing an Arduino and a Motor Shield to control the machines, 
and the software side developing the Watson Speech JS SDK that was used to capture and transcribe the user's voice.
There was also a python script running in the background that orchestrated everything.
