We built a Watson-powered candy machine for IBM's 2016 InterConnect event: it gives either sweet or sour candy 
depending on if one said nice things or mean things.

I worked on primarily the hardware side, rebuilding the candy machines and programing an Arduino and a Motor Shield to control them.
There was also a python script running in the background that orchestrated everything.
