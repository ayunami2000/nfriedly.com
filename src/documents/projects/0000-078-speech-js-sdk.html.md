Easy to use <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> for working with the Watson Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech services in web browsers.

Can synthesize voice audio from text input and transcribe speech from various sources including microphones, `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, and files. 
Supports Promises, Streans, and outputting directly to a given HTML element, including live-updating.

The library is built around a series of composable Node.js-style streams, and a few helper methods for common use cases.
