<img class="right" src="/img/portfolio/gem-city-js.png" alt="" />After moving to Tipp City and not finding any local JavaScript User Group, I founded Tipp JS and started hosting meetups. I later joined forces with Sparkbox in Dayton to create Gem City JS.

I've given presentations on a variety of topics including an intro to node.js, unit Testing with Jasmine, using node.js to control physical hardware, Express.js, Meteor, require.js, LESS, and CoffeeScript. (Some of these were at other events.)
