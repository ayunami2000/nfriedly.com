My second web proxy, this one built in node.js and designed from the ground up to be faster and compatible with more sites - try out Google Instant Search for an example.

It modifies the data on the fly instead of downloading the entire page, then parsing it, then passing it along to the user.

Continuos Deployment: Travis CI automatically runs tests and deploys to Heroku after each GitHub push.
