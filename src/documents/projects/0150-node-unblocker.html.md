My second web proxy, this one built in node.js and designed from the ground up to be faster and compatible with more sites - try out Google Instant Search for an example.

It modifies the data on the fly instead of downloading the entire page, then parsing it, then passing it along to the user.

Automatically runs basic integration tests on each push curtsey of Travis CI. Beefing these up and adding automatic deployment (Continuos Integration) is on the todo list.
