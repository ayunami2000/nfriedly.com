I regularly write technical articles on javascript, php, and web development related issues for the <a href="/techblog">tech blog</a>.

I built the wordpress theme to integrate with the rest of my site and take advantage of several wordpress features including tags, comments, gravitars.

Also configured plugins including BackUpWordPress, WP Super Cache, Akismet, NoSpamNX, SyntaxHighlighter Evolved, Comment Notifier, Comment Referrers, Google XML Sitemaps, and Dofollow.
