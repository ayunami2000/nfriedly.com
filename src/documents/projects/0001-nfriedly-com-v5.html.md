Rebuilt the website from scratch with a state of the art mobile-first design made for speed and usability.

Stands on the shoulders of giants, using DocPad and a collection of plugins for content generation, Bootstrap and LESS for CSS scaffolding and preprocessing; Github, Cloudfront, and Travis CI for hosting and continuous deployment. Artwork is a combination of photos my own personal library, creative commons photos from flickr, icons by Font Awesome and Font Mfizz.
