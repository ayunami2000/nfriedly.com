I built this to look up ODB-II diagnostic codes from my phone. (And also because I wanted to learn <a href="http://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> a bit better.)

The tool searches through a database of codes as you type and also gives some general information about ODB-II and how to acquire the tools.

Continuously integrated with a suite of CasperJS (PhantomJS) tests and continuously deployed to Meteor's infrastructure after each GitHub push via Travis CI: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nfriedly/Meteor-ODB-II.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nfriedly/Meteor-ODB-II)
