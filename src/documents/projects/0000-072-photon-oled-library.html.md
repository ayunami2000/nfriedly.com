Library to connect an [Adafruit SSD1351 1.5" Color OLED](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1431) breakout board to a
[Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit).

I built on top of the work by Adafruit and the Particle communities; taking the working driver, adding a bit of polish, and publishing it.

My contributions included packaging it in the Particle library format, adding and tweaking the example,
adding wiring instructions, and generally improving the documentation.
