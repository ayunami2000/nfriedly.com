I Joined Sociable Labs in 2010 and have been defining the field of Social Commerce with them ever since. I built the front-end framework that manages feature placement, cross-domain AJAX (<abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</abbr>), inter-feature communication, analytics, and several other aspects of the applications. I also built and/or supported a variety of the applications including the Gallery, Targeted Referral, Welcome, and others.

I implemented the Jam.js / Require.js module bundling system that compiles a unique JS file for each customer with their configuration and only the features they use so that their visitors have the smallest download possible. 

I set up automated unit testing of the front-end code with Jasmine and jasmine-node. as well as code quality and complexity checks with JSHint and js-complexity-viz.

I've also written a fair amount of Java code for our Jetty / RESTEasy / PostgreSQL back-end.
