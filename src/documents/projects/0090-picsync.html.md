<img class="right" src="/img/portfolio/picsync-phone-shadow.png" alt="" />PicSync automatically uploads photos you take on your Android phone to a private album. It will then remind you about the photos the next time you log into Facebook allowing you to review and post your favorites.
PicSync is still under development and is coming along nicely. Features coming soon include a backup service, Facebook Login, and credit card payments. <a href="http://twitter.com/picsyncapp">Follow the development on twitter.</a>
